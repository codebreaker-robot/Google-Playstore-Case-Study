# Google-Playstore-Case-Study
A case study on the most promising apps on the google play store

The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app.For which, you can ask questions like:

1.Does a higher size or price of an app necessarily mean that it would perform better than the other apps? 
2.Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
